To install the package, assure to have write permissions for you Perl 
Library directories. Then do the lines:

   perl Makefile.PL

   make install

This will install the Laola:: module hierarchy to your system and also
the demo programs:

   lclean  - cleans trash out of OLE docs
   ldat    - lists PropertySets in OLE docs
   lhalw   - converts MS Word 6+ docs to text
   lls     - lists file structure of OLE docs

If you need assure where to install executables, library files and manpages, 
install the distribution with the PREFIX option, like:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local/

   make install
